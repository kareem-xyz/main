TASKS 
    # Try debugging or refining the search results for example:
        # BUG: movies with original title not in english won't show up
            - possible fix is to redownload the imdb website to scan for alternative titles and so on, because the api doesn't allow for that currently.
        - Sorting to show the best movie or most popular or most matching (could use len() here)
        - Unallowing bad input or manipulative
        - Find a solution to the no movie found problem
        - might have to fall back to the method of using a database.

    # Rename the variables exchanges throughout the website

    # Refine search.html
        reforming the image sizes and row sizes, ratios seem like a good start

    # Future ideas (extras):

        - show a browse page with the top movies in imdb, or maybe in the homescreen itself.
        - work on efficency and perhaps migrating the computation of varibales in jinnja to the python flask app
        
    # DONE :   
        - add a background to layout.html (for example a blurred picture of red cinema seats, or maybe blurred posters of films)
        - Change from storing data internally in javascript code into using sessionstorage.
        - CSS Work on Choose Button (highlight chosen and unhighlight the others, by unhighlighting under the list div)
        - Implement data exchange using ajax between javascript and python flask. 
        - reform truncation for text description
        function choose(button):
        {
            ##....some code

            # for example: list = button.getAttribute('data-list');
            # buttons = list.querySelectorAll('button');
            # for (i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) 
            {
                buttons[i].classList.remove("btn-primary");
                buttons[i].classList.add("btn-outline-primary")
            }
            chosenbutton.classList.add("btn-primary");
        }
        -show a bootstrap loading spinner to show page loading. use javascript for toggling visibility.
        might require to change how the form element of search work to run a js function first, and then redirect to /search
