I would say that the way Spotify chracterizes their listerners is fine, but I have a suggestion that might prove helpful.
Instead of taking the average of the user's top 100 songs only, the system should take the total length of sessions per each mood.
A session being a period of time where the user listened to songs of a simmilar mood. This might be helpful because people often play music in
the background that is in varying types of moods. By changing the Aura value to change by sessions and not single songs, this
might reduce the effect of single songs charcterizing the Aura.
