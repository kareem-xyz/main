Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: almoost all the results of the simulations after the 10 simulations were similar. The results didn't vary much. germany stayed ontop.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: 100000 times should be enough, as the result is more or less the same as the highest accuracy one, but the time is much shorter
